### Objective

Thanks for checking out XCW's front-end coding challenge.

Your assignment is to build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Brief

Your challenge is to build out a tip calculator app.

### Tasks

-   Implement assignment using:

    -   Language: **Dart**
    -   Framework: **Flutter**

    Your users should be able to:

    -   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
    -   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
    -   Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.
The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.
You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized. There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **Dart** best practices
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested?
-   Documentation: is the API well-documented?

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
